Artemisa 1.0
************

Troubleshooting
===============


1) Artemisa doesn't find my audio device.

    1) Cause: the device /dev/dsp doesn' exist.
    
    Solution:
    The audio device must be under the file /dev/dsp.

    If you are using Fedora or another distro that uses Pulse Audio, 
    you can try, running as root, the following commands:

    modprobe snd_mixer_oss
    modprobe snd_pcm_oss
    modprobe snd_seq_oss

    This should create /dev/dsp.

    2) Cause: bad configuration of the audio device in Artemisa.

    Solution:
    If the audio device still won't work, it might be possible that it is not 
    correctly configured in Artemisa.

    You should first run "artemisa.py -g" in order to get a list of the
    available audio devices found by Artemisa. Then, you should remember the
    number of the most suitable device, and set this number in the file 
    /conf/artemisa.conf.
