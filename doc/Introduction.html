<h2>What is Artemisa?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-artemisa" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Artemisa is a honeypot software designed for VoIP networks which implements the SIP protocol. Basically, it registers
itself just like a conventional telephone to the registrar server inside the enterprise domain where it is deployed, and
detects malicious activity at an early stage. In an advanced deployment, Artemisa can play a role in the real-time
adjustment of the security policies of the domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-honeypot-and-why-is-it-needed">
<h2>What is a honeypot and why is it needed?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-honeypot-and-why-is-it-needed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>A honeypot is an information system resource whose value lies in unauthorized or illicit use of that resource.</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>A honeypot is like a bait, which simulates being some well-known system or service, that without being part of the
production itself, it has the aim of watching and studying the behavior of anyone who interacts with it. In other words,
a honeypot is a parallel system to the production one, whose main objective is to simulate being this last one, and
to achieve that anyone who interacts with it believes that she/he is doing it on the production system.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a VoIP network like this:</p>
<img alt="_images/voip_honeypot_1_en.png" src="_images/voip_honeypot_1_en.png" />
<p>As is shown in the picture, the network has an Internet connection through a firewall. Suppose
you have received some SIP attacks last month and therefore you want to improve its security. Setting up
the firewall in order to deny any unknown IP address is not a practical solution, since you would
likely be blocking many interesting calls whose IP addresses you don&#8217;t know. Then, here is where
Artemisa takes place. Suppose that Artemisa is registered with twenty extensions to the SIP
registrar server or PBX. When a hacker tries to investigate the network, she/he will find out the extensions
of Artemisa. By that time, Artemisa will have the calls investigated, and will have reported the
intruder. With this information, the system administrator will be able to properly configure
the firewall. It&#8217;s also possible to make Artemisa run some user-configurable script that automatically adjusts the
domain policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-it-work">
<h2>How does it work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-it-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Artemisa is based on the analysis of SIP messages. It analyzes the data found in the messages, and
according to the results obtained by several verifications, Artemisa classifies the message. Such
classification can be: <em>attack tool</em>, <em>scanning</em>, <em>ringing</em>, <em>SPIT</em>, among others.</p>
<p>You just need to run Artemisa in a machine inside your domain and configure it in order to let it
register at least with one extension to the SIP registrar server of your domain. Is recommended to
deploy Artemisa in a virtual machine in order not to compromise a production machine.</p>
<p>The following picture briefly depicts how Artemisa works:</p>
<img alt="_images/example1_en.png" src="_images/example1_en.png" />
<p>First, a call is received and it&#8217;s addressed to Artemisa (of course, the intruder doesn&#8217;t know about its existence).
Artemisa answers the call, and at the same time investigates it. After finishing the investigation, it
shows the report of results on screen and sends it by e-mail (if it&#8217;s configured).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-the-call-analysis">
<h2>About the call analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-call-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The analysis involves the following points (we explain them briefly):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Look for fingerprints: The attack could have been created with a well-known attacking tool.</li>
<li>Check the domain names: Are the domain names found in the SIP messages real? Can some public information about them be obtained?</li>
<li>Check the SIP ports: Are the SIP ports of the attacker opened as they are pretended to be?</li>
<li>Check media ports: Are media ports opened?</li>
<li>Check request URI: Is the call (in such case) addressed to the honeypot?</li>
<li>Check for ACK: Does the caller/attacker send the correct ACK messages?</li>
<li>Check received media: Is there (RTP) media involved?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-the-results">
<h2>About the results<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the investigation of the call concludes, the results are shown in different manners:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Console of Artemisa</li>
<li>Plain text file on directory <em>/results</em></li>
<li>HTML file on directory  <em>/results</em></li>
<li>Notification by e-mail (if it&#8217;s activated and properly configured in <em>/conf/artemisa.conf</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an example of the results shown in the console of Artemisa (for privacy reasons in this document, the domain names and IP addresses have been replaced with &#8220;X&#8221;):</p>

<div class="section" id="user-configurable-scripts">
<h2>User-configurable scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#user-configurable-scripts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are some <em>bash</em> scripts that are executed when the investigation of a call is finished. The script executed
is appropriate to the nature of the call (e.g. SPIT). These are found on directory <em>/scripts</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>on_flood.sh</em></li>
<li><em>on_spit.sh</em></li>
<li><em>on_scanning.sh</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Each script is executed with a set of arguments given, which are defined in file <em>/conf/actions.conf</em>. These parameters
are for example: IP addresses, port numbers, extensions, et cetera. The administrador is able to use these information
provided by Artemisa to create automatical responses to the attacks, e.g. setting a rule in <em>iptables</em> for dropping all
packets incoming from the attacker&#8217;s IP address when flood is detected. Interesting ideas for usage of these scripts are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Setting firewall (e.g. iptables) rules to drop the attacker IP</li>
<li>Setting rules in the VoIP PBX (e.g. Asterisk) to hang up calls incoming with certain IP or extension</li>
<li>Launch other tools (e.g. svcrash.py to crash SIPVicious)</li>
